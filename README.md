# ER Vision Pipeline
====================

This project is our image analyse for our data captured ROS bags.
OpenCV and PCL processing of our sample data

Check INSTALL.md to see how to setup the system

# System

We use the Realsense D435 camera as our main platform.

# Color experiments
Near-Infrared, or NIR, is the waveband ranging roughly from 700 to 1000nm

Our camera laser sits on:
Laser Wavelength 850nm ± 10 nm nominal @ 20°C

Left and Right Imager are able to see in the following wavelengths:

400 to 865 (Visible and Infrared) @ 98% transmission
rate or higher at all viewing and transmitting angles
